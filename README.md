# tech-ases-zwift

### What I used?

  1. ```WebdriverIO``` - great API to work with UI 
  2. ```Mocha + Chai(expect)``` - I used it for assertions.
  3. ```chromedriver``` - driver to run Chrome.
  
### Needed software:
  1. Installed ```NodeJS(v12.16.1 or higher)``` on your device.
  2. Installed ```NPM``` ( not sure which version exactly, NodeJS have to care about it :) ) I have v6.14.4 on my device.
  3. Installed ```Google Chrome v83.0``` ( WebdriverIO will download the chromedriver ).
  
### Steps to run tests: 
  1. ```git clone https://github.com/Sharygin-Aleksei/tech-ases-zwift.git```
  2. ```cd tech-ases-zwift```
  3. ```npm install```
  4. ```npm test```
